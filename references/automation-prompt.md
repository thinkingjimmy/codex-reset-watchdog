Use the $codex-reset-watchdog skill.

Run from the installed codex-reset-watchdog working directory:

Command:
node scripts/check_once.mjs --json

Follow the skill's Automation run protocol. Return an emoji-led actionable/no-action report. Alert only for future actionable resets; treat completed or past reset posts as historical context.

Do not emit progress narration while running. Do not inspect or update automation memory during routine runs. If the initial working directory does not contain `scripts/check_once.mjs`, silently switch to the configured Automation working directory that does.

If JSON status is `transient_network_error`, `network_diagnostic`, or `error`, treat it as a watchdog operational issue, not a possible Codex reset. Never use the reset banners for source/network/state failures.

Omit the full repeated table on routine `new_items=0` runs when no future actionable or unclear signal remains. Do not output raw JSON, process narration, or routine memory notes.
